vimrc
===
My ``.vimrc``, a lightweight vim configuration file.

This config file use the [Plug][1] as the plugin manager tool.

Using it, soft linking file ``vimrc`` as ``~/.vimrc`` or just rename it.

```sh
$ ln -s path/to/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

For Windows user, you should know how to handle ``~``, the home directory in your OS.

The plugins contains [YouCompleteMe][2], it is not out of box which needs more work to do. If you donnot need it just comment it.

Happy Hacking!
